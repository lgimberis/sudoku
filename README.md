This is an implementation of Sudoku in pure javascript.
To play, click an empty square and enter a valid digit with the keyboard. 

The script will generate a sudoku board on the element with class 'sudoku'.
If there is an element with class 'hexoku', it will instead generate a 4x4 grid with hex digits 0-f.

The game is styled according to the following CSS classes:
sudoku
sudoku-row
sudoku-square
sudoku-square-fixed
sudoku-square-text
sudoku-clicked
The 'hexoku' variant requires replacing 'sudoku' with 'hexoku' in the above CSS class names.
